This is a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) for a bug with firebase-tools repo on versions greater than 10.2.2 not being able to run the firebase functions emulator.

I am is using node version 16 but also tested on 14 and 12 with the same results

## How to reproduce
* Clone and `npm install`
* Build the functions app `nx build functions --generatePackageJson`
* Install firebase-tools 10.2.2 to prove your setup is working `npm i -g firebase-tools@10.2.2`
* Run the local emulator `firebase emulators:start --project test` if it all works continue
* Install the latest version of firebase-tools `npm i -g firebase-tools@latest`
* Run the local emulator `firebase emulators:start --project test` and then review the firebase-debug.log
